# Water-Potability
Kaggle has a dataset on statistics of water samples and their potability
Ten columns. 3276 rows.
I ran an imputer, a scaler, and 5 different fitting algorithms using pipelines and GridSearchCV.
Got close to 70 percent final accuracy, but never quite reached it.
Others achieved up to 85% accuracy.
